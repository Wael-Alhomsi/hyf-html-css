1. Research how to create a hidden file and how to display it using ls command.

Commands are:
touch .new-file (this creates a hidden file named new-file)
ls -a

2. Research how to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command.
E.g. How would you create 'fun' directory along with all directories in the path below:
/c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

command is:
mkdir -p these/folders/are/just/for/fun

3. Execute following commands terminal:
echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
wc -c fun

Verify number of characters in the file.

The result is 18

4. Research how to append something in the file *WITHOUT* a newline character.
E.g.
echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
cat fun
Output of "cat fun" is
test
another test

How would you use echo command, so that output would be:
testanother test

Commands are:
echo -n "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
